# **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling Algorithm with GUI**

## **Overview**
This project implements a **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling Algorithm** using Java. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `Swing` to simulate and visualize the scheduling process for multiple processes based on their priority.

---

## **Features**
- User-friendly GUI to input process details such as:
  - Process ID
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time
  - Priority
- Displays key scheduling results:
  - Start Time
  - Completion Time
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Response Time (RT)
- Real-time visualization of scheduling order.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Swing**: For GUI development.
- **JTable**: To display scheduling results.

## **Setup and Installation**
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) is installed on your system.
   - Verify installation with:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   javac prio1.java
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java prio1
   ```

## **How to Use**
1. Launch the application by running the above command.
2. Input process details (e.g., Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority).
3. Click the **Submit** button to view the scheduling results.
4. Analyze the calculated metrics and process order displayed in the table.

## **Screenshots**
*(Include screenshots of the GUI to provide users with a visual overview.)*

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add support for Preemptive Priority Scheduling.
- Export results to a file (e.g., CSV or Excel).
- Develop a web-based interface for broader accessibility.
